# general guidelines!!
- if u change code, pleaase! export your changed scripts to `scripts/` AND comment your changes there!

- *always* make sure ur keybinds dont overlap with anything else *and* are properly written on the instructions page!
  if you dont know how, when you edit the text, youll see a block of code like
  ```actionscript
  [
    x ...
    y ...
    spacing " " 91
  ]...
  ```
  to add new lines, duplicate this code, add `509` to the `y` value and keep the `x` the same as the previous line.
